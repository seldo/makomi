For more information check out the very information Wikipedia article\non [Futures and Promises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises).\n\n## About version 0.2.x\n\nVersion 0.2.x and the master branch represent a shift in oath's core fucus. Instead of providing helper\nfunctions for manipulating the result set and deep chaining, this version allows you to manipulate the\nresult set directly, and provides helpers if this is to be done asyncronously. Docs coming shortly.\n\n## Installation\n\nOath is available for both server-side and the browser.\n\n### Node.js\n\nPackage is available through [npm](http://npmjs.org):\n\n    npm install oath\n\n### Browser\n\nDownload the package and include either the normal or minimized build in your HTML header.\n\n    <script src=\"/public/js/oath.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n    <script src=\"/public/js/oath.min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n\n## Help, resources, and issues?\n\n* The annotated source / full API documentation for versions 0.1.x is available at [alogicalparadox.com/oath](http://alogicalparadox.com/oath/).\n* If you have questions or issues, please use this projects [Github Issues](https://github.com/logicalparadox/oath/issues).\n\n## Contributors\n\nInterested in contributing?
