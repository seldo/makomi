.makomi contains the "meta-source": descriptions of the UI, the logic,
etc. that are independent of the engines used. It is the source of
truth about what the app should do. Outside of .makomi the generator
can edit any and all files; if you edit the generated files we do not
guarantee that every engine will respect/remember those edits.
